  "In the very little I know of you, I've seen how full of spirit you are.\nIt's almost contagious that it makes the people around feel at home.\nBut only after diving a little I realised, you do that despite you're struggles. Despite the responsibilities.\nHow you keep standing up for people while you yourself wade through storms picking up your pieces.",
  "Battered mind and a bruised heart. Leaving the body aimless with neither able to guide.\nWe lay in the darkness mourning everything we lost. Sorrow and pain slowly replacing all the precious things that defined us.\nMaybe one of these nights, instead of staring helplessly into the void. We realise, a lot more than what we lost, is the worth of our pride.\nLife can be beautiful again and maybe we get back to feeling ourselves. But only if we take one of the many chances life gives us.\nSo we push ourselves back to light paving a new day of our own. It might be sunny, it might be a storm. But we will no more falter our stride.",
  "They say eyes are the windows to the soul.\nAnd somewhere beyond everything harsh you've endured, your eyes hold a spark glittering.\nDespite the volumes of turmoil your eyes speak, you have always made sure your smile is what defines you.",
  "Kadalani vanam kosam taane karchavthunte vasantham\nKurise varsham kaare tana kanneeru kaada\nKarigi vaadipothunte tanaloni meghaala raagam\nAlasina vasantham kosam saagarame aavirai raada",
  "Chakkaga parachina mabbula parupu.\nDupatta teesi hushaaruga legustunna Suryudu.\n500 kotla yellu kudapettukunna velugu adi.\nGaalilo kitiki. Pakkane nuvvu.\nAntha velugu kevalam nee mokham pai padi merisipovadam kosame unnattu.\nAlaantappudu, kitiki avathala entha chitram aina,\nEe merupu mundu chinnaboyedega."
